### PROJECT SIGNALS

## Introduction
Estimating breath rate and heart rate from ECG signals involves analyzing the characteristics of the ECG waveform to identify peaks corresponding to both heartbeats and respiratory cycles. 

## Heart rate estimation
Heart rate estimation involves calculating the number of heartbeats per minute (bpm) from the time intervals between consecutive R-peaks in an ECG signal. The formula to estimate heart rate (HR) is:

HR=60/R-R-interval

Where the R-R interval is the time interval between consecutive R-peaks in seconds

## breath rate estimation

This project focuses on estimating breath rate from ECG signals. Breath rate, expressed in breaths per minute (bpm), is calculated from the time intervals between consecutive peaks corresponding to respiratory cycles in the ECG signal.

BR=60/Respiratory-cycle interval
